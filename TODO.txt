- Add script to fetch TianoCore OVMF firmware images instead of using provided
- Each arch uses config file instead of seperate GNUmakefile?
- Higher-half kernel with paging (exit boot services and construct page tables)
- Paging!
- I/O operations on files in VFSs
- Hashing
- Pool page orders are 0, why?
- Using the compiled stage 2 !!
- Eliminate excessive $(CURDIR)
- libc
- Update some things to const now that I actually know what it means, like string length
- UEFI not working?!
