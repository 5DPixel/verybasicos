- Add script to fetch TianoCore OVMF firmware images instead of using provided
- Each arch uses config file instead of seperate GNUmakefile?
- Higher-half kernel with paging (exit boot services and construct page tables)
- Paging!
- Buddy allocation (a note here about it... again!)
- Use RBTs to manage buddy allocation, because I already use them for page allocation, why not re-use them?
- So, allocate n pages to then initialise the higher-level arbitrarily sized heap allocator, so you can allocate j bytes where j isn't necessarily a whole number integer of pages
